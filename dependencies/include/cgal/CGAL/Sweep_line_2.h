/*! \class
 * Sweep_line_2 is a class that implements the sweep line algorithm based
 * on the algorithm of Bentley and Ottmann.
 * It extends the algorithm to support not only segments but general x-monotone
 * curves as well and isolated points.
 * The X_monotone_curve_2 type and Point_2 are defined by the traits class that 
 * is one of the template arguments.
 *
 * The algorithm is also extended to support the following degenerate cases:
 * - vertical segments
 * - multiple (more then two) curves intersecting at one point
 * - curves beginning and ending on other curves.
 * - overlapping curves
 *
 * General flow:
 * After the initialization stage, the events are handled from left to right.
 * 
 * For each event
 *
 *  First pass - handles special cases in which curves start or end 
 *               at the interior of another curve
 *  Handle left curves - iterate over the curves that intersect 
 *               at the event point and defined lexicographically to the left
 *               of the event. 
 *  Handle right curves - iterate over the curves that intersect 
 *               the event point and defined lexicographically to the right
 *               of the event point. This is where new intersection points 
 *               are calculated.
 * End
 *
 * Convensions through out the code:
 * In order to make the code as readable as possible, some convensions were 
 * made in regards to variable naming:
 *
 * xp - is the intersection point between two curves
 * slIter - an iterator to the status line, always points to a curve.
